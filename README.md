## Architecture üöÄ
This project was made using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

Created using:
- Clean architecture [Clean architecture 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-guide-to-clean-architecture/) y [Clean architecture 2](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-44143-1_2.pdf)

- Solid [Solid](https://kessler.tech/software-architecture/solid/)

- DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself):
  DRY is a software design principle that promotes reuse and efficiency. The core idea is to avoid code duplication. If you have functionality or logic that is repeated in different parts of your application, you should extract it to a centralized location (such as a function, class, or module) to avoid redundancies.

- Cubits (as state manager for views):
  It is an alternative to using setState directly or other patterns like BLoC or Provider.
  - Features:
    Simple: Provides an easy way to handle local state in a widget.
    Lightweight: Doesn't require a lot of additional code.
    Event-driven: State changes are triggered by events.

## UI Design üé®
